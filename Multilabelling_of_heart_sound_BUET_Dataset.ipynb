        "*   **Denoising Function Defined:** A Python function named `butter_bandpass_filter` was successfully implemented using `numpy` and `scipy.signal`. This function is designed to apply a Butterworth bandpass filter to an audio signal for denoising. The function correctly normalizes cut-off frequencies and applies the filter using `signal.butter()` and `signal.filtfilt()`.\n",
